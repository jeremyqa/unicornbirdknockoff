# unicornbirdknockoff
This was a hack day project.  
I started with this tutorial: https://www.joshmorony.com/game-mechanics-in-phaser-simple-helicopter-obstacle-course/ -- It was a pretty good starting point, and let me skip worrying about some of the initial setup boilerplate.

Control the unicorn with the mouse or space bar.  Click/tap to accellerate upwards, let go to fall down.
Pick up coins for more points.
Avoid the austerity pandas (https://twitter.com/cbinsights/status/729632114338091009?lang=en)
Press escape to give up.

It tracks your top score and the cost of the next panda you'll hit.  Picking up coins increases the cost of the next panda, and actually hitting a panda doubles the cost of the next one. So it kind of works out like having multiple lives.

I had some trouble making the game actually fun at first, but I think I hit an okay point.  In an earlier version, before I made the panda costs go up, it was easy to get to a point where it was hard to lose.  Like, you got too big to fail.  This was amusing given the narrative context (such as there is), but it wasn't any fun.

Thanks.
